It is preferred if you can run the XDP-tutorial directly on your existing
laptops Linux distro. This require minimum kernel version 4.19, and
preferably kernel version 4.20. If these requirements are met, then you
don't need to setup/use the VM images, and you can instead follow and
install the software packages described in <../setup_dependencies.md>.

You *only* need to read further if you want/need to use the provided VM
(Virtual Machine) image.

# Howto use VM image<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

Howto use the instructor provided VM image is described in
<using_vm_image.md>.

# How were this created<a id="sec-2" name="sec-2"></a>

If you are interested in how this VM image were created (based on a Fedora29
Cloud Image) you can read <create_vm_image.md>. But that is not relevant
for the tutorial.
